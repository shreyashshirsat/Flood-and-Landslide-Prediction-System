Flood and Landslide Prediction
Welcome to the Flood and Landslide Prediction project! This repository contains code, models, and datasets focused on forecasting flood and landslide risks using machine learning and geospatial data.

Overview
This project aims to provide accurate, timely, and actionable predictions for flood and landslide events. Leveraging a combination of meteorological, topographical, and historical data, our models help communities and governments take proactive measures to minimize natural disaster impacts.

Features
1. Predicts flood and landslide risks for given locations.
2. Utilizes real-time environmental data and historical event information.
3. Employs state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms.
4. Visualizes risk levels on interactive maps.
5. Easy-to-use interface for both technical and non-technical users.
